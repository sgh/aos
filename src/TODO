* Finish UART-driver
* Set_stdint() and set_stdout() manupulate task-struct
* Printf to write to the task stdout

* Finish ioctl. Need variable number of arguments.
* Process exit routine. Posibility of starting, joining and waiting on processes.
* Abstraction of interrupt-code.
* Central entry-point for selected interrupts. This way we can do context-switch in conjunction with all interrupts.
		It will improve interaction-response times.
* Fragment-store should allocate FRAGMENT_SEGMENTS with malloc.
* Methode to monopolize the time in a safe manner.
* Precision of sleeps
* Meassuring of  interrupt-latencies runtime
* Set timequantum at contex-shidt
* Busywait fx. at small delays
* Process-priority reverse proportinal with average cpu-burst
* Counter on fragment-store to allow for O(1) size determination
