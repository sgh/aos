* Implement initcalls-section and run through initcall during startup.
* UART-driver
* set_stdint() and set_stdout() manupulate task-struct
* printf så write to the task stdout

* Finish ioctl. Need variable number of arguments.
* Process exit routine. Posibility of starting, joining and waiting on processes.
* Abstraction of interrupt-code.
* Central entry-point for selected interrupts. This way we can do context-switch in conjunction with all interrupts.
		It will improve interaction-response times.
* Fragment-store should allocate FRAGMENT_SEGMENTS with malloc.
* Integration of memory-management layer
* Methode to monopolize the time in a safe manner.
* precision of sleeps
* meassuring of  interrupt-latencies runtime
* set timequantum at contex-shidt
* busywait fx. at small delays
* Counter on fragment-store to allow for O(1) size determination
